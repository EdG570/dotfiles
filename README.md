# The Rubylove Dotfiles

I have a confession to make. I am a thief. I steal great ideas and source code and make it my own. Want to know who I have been influenced by and stolen from? Check out my extensive thank you in my [ruby manifesto](https://github.com/rubylove/ruby_programming_manifesto).

My philosophy is this, test, integrate, extend. And to me, workflow is essential. Therefore I am always on the look out for better tools and workflows and my dotfiles are an extension of that.

The following "dot" files are included. The installer will set your shell to ZSH to serve you the kick ass prompt included. You might want to install the lastest zshell from homebrew or apt before raking this install.

* ackrc
* gemrc
* gitignore
* vimrc
* zlogin (empty)
* zshrc


## Installation

Installation is easy. Clone, cd, rake, profit.

```sh
cd && git clone https://github.com/thatrubylove/dotfiles.git && cd ~/dotfiles && rake
```
